Hi Everyone!

As some of you know, CS Women is running a technical workshop series:

>This funding will support a series of technical workshops designed to build 
>every day skills that students who are introduced to computer science in an 
>academic setting often lack. The workshops will be taught by Computer Science 
>graduate students (and some exceptional undergraduates) of all genders. We 
>aspire to have gender parity in our workshop instructors. Our initial cohort 
>of instructors will have the opportunity to develop a curriculum for a diverse 
>audience; we believe this opportunity presents an attractive supplement or 
>alternative to teaching assistantships for students who want to become 
>teachers.

>We intend to promote a collaborative atmosphere where attendees feel 
>comfortable taking risks. Our target level of technological literacy is that 
>of a first-year graduate student. However, we invite all students in the Five 
>College Consortium to attend. We intend to make our teaching resources 
>publicly available and encourage those who have reached proficiency to lead 
>future workshops.

The target audience are _all_ (not just female-identified) first-year graduate students, however, *all students are invited to attend and participate*. On *Tuesday, October 20* in *CS 150/151* from *4pm--6pm*, we will be holding a *Bootcamp/Office Hours* to help students get set up. You can drop in (don't forget your laptop!) at any time during that window. If you cannot make the office hours, we will be posting instructions for you to get set up at your own leisure after we run the office hours. The *first workshop* will be on *October 27th*, and the topic is *git*. Starting with the git workshop, we will be serving light refreshments.

Please feel free to forward this email to anyone who might be interested. We look forward to seeing you!
